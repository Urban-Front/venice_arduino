# Venice Arduino

> Arduino code for Venice

### Letter Example

Letters across a 60x13 zig-zag matrix.

### Sender / Receiver Example

Sending and receiving signals across arduinos. See [here](https://iot-guider.com/arduino/serial-communication-between-two-arduino-boards/) for example.

Another possible way to do this [here](https://www.circuitbasics.com/wired-communication-between-two-arduinos/).

### pi_serial + raspberry-pi-communication

Send and receive data from raspberry pi to multiple arduinos simultaneously.

In this case we'd use one raspberry pi to control multiple arduinos, basically to keep them on the same timeline for the animations.
